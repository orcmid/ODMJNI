           ODMJNI: JAVA BRIDGE TO ODMA DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES
           ========================================================

                  PRESERVATION OF JNI DEVELOPMENT ARTIFACTS
                  -----------------------------------------

    ODMJNI was a project to provide access to the Open Document Management
    API (ODMA) middleware for integration of document management services
    desktop functions with productivity applications.  The sweet spot was
    support for the ODMA32 bridge in Microsoft Office Word.

    The ODMA32 bridge was a DLL that provided a C Language API to clients,
    and a COM x86 interface from registered document-management system
    client services.

    ODMJNI is an additional layer above the ODMA32 bridge to provide access
    from Java-based desktop applications.  The way that was accomplished involves the Java Native Interface (JNI) and it is instructive in how
    that adaptation was arranged.

    ODMJNI uses a particular hack involving the Java methods passing pointers
    around under the guise of integers.  This device depended on x86
    pointers and none of ODMJNI is suitable in today's x64 world.

    There is no intention of reviving ODMJNI, especially in the absence of
    any ODMA64.  This preservation is here because the use of COM behind
    the scenes (essentially between the Java classes and the native DLL) may
    be instructive.  It also should be understood that JNI is now enough
    different that the trick may no longer be feasible.

    There is also an instructive provision of COM interfaces that can be
    treated as either C++ interfaces or C Language structs with a vtable
    pointer as the first member.  I confess that figuring out how I managed
    that is the incentive for digging up this old code as I work on The
    Miser Project on GitHub (https://orcmid.github.io/miser).
