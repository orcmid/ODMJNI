               ODMJNI: JAVA BRIDGE TO ODMA DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT SERVICES
               ========================================================

                  PRESERVATION OF JNI DEVELOPMENT ARTIFACTS
                  -----------------------------------------

    nfoTools is a collection of utilities and software components.  The
    tools are designed for use in composition of larger software projects
    for information-processing applications (and games of course).  nfoTools
    can apply anywhere in the complete learning-and-improvement lifecycle of
    software projects.

    nfoTools includes a Toolcraft on-ramp that supports beginners who want
    to understand more about programming and the tacit understanding of
    experienced software developers.  Crawl first, then walk, then run.
    Progressive discloser is used in a way that allows more-experienced
    visitors to quickly skip over details they already know.  Review of the
    basics may be useful though.

    Emphasis is on development of software for Microsoft Windows and using
    Microsoft Windows desktop tools as instruments of such efforts.  Only
    freely-available tools are required in addition to a Windows PC or laptop.
    The working language is English. This is how the author is equipped.

    While nfoTools are useful independently, they are chosen and developed
    first in service of specific software efforts originally housed on
    nfoWare.com, nfoWorks.org, and more-recent efforts now on GitHub.
