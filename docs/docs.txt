                              ===================

        <https://github.com/orcmid/ODMJNI/blob/main/docs/docs.txt>

                   ODMJNI DOCUMENTATION GITHUB PAGES FOLDER
                   ----------------------------------------

    Documentation of ODMJNI is provided here as the source of GitHub Pages
    for automatic publishing to <https://orcmid.github.io/ODMJNI/>.
    This scaffolding page is also published there as passive but reachable
    content.

    This scaffolding, and further arrangements are a case of document
    engineering applied to the docEng project and site themselves.

    Because ODMJNI is for preservation of an existing development tree
    and of web pages around its development, this will not have the
    conventional Document Engineering hybridForms, although FrontPage
    organization and tooling will be employed.

 TODO

  * Explain how this folder is used to generate the GitHub pages, possibly
    with additional folders that are about the scaffolding and construction
    materials.

  * Add Apache license and notices page ?? .  They apply to the docEng repo,
    what about the pages published here at docs/ ?

  * Figure out how to deal with the handling of Hugo frameworks in this
    context.  I want to experiment first.  How will that work exactly.

  * I have not completed About and Construction stuff.  I do need to decide
    how much to handle that.

  * Bring hybridForm here from orcmid.github.io/miser and retro-fit it into
    usage here and also as a model.
